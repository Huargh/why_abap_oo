<p>These code snippets are examples from the training "Why ABAP OO?" or ABAP Objects for ABAP-Veterans.</br>
They are intended to show both the similarities to procedural ABAP as well as the advantages of using ABAP OO.</br>
Most examples are based on the Flight Model, in order to ensure that they can be executed on any SAP-System</br></p>
<p>If you already looked into ABAP OO and disliked it (BC401?), you really should take a second look, 
if only for the new syntax, introduced since ABAP 7.4</p>
